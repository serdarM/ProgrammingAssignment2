## The example that comes with the assignment is a good reference
## to how thes functions should be implemented.
##
## 1. A caching utility function to hold the inverse of the submatrix
## 2. A function that utilizes the cache to get the inverse of the matrix


makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

}


## Write a short comment describing this function

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
